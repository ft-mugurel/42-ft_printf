# 42 ft_printf Project

The **ft_printf** project is a recreation of the standard C library function `printf`. The goal is to implement a simplified version of `printf` that handles various format specifiers, such as `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, and `%p`.

This project focuses on understanding variadic functions, string formatting, and handling different data types. You'll learn how to parse format strings, manage variable arguments, and output formatted text to the standard output.

By completing this project, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how `printf` works internally, improve your skills in string manipulation, and learn to handle complex functions with variable arguments.
